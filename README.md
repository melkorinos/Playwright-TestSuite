## Install

1. Clone the solution locally, preferably under your `C:\` drive.
1. Ensure you have an [LTS Node.js version](https://nodejs.org/) installed, [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control, and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your code editor.
1. Install typescript and ts node globally with `npm install -g ts-node typescript`
1. Run `npm ci` in terminal. You have to be in the root directory of the project `C:\AutomationTests`. We run `npm CI` instead of `npm i` as to not update dependecies during regular PRs.
1. Run `npx playwright install` to download the newest web drivers
1. Copy the contents of `.env.example` file and create a new file `.env` and input the values.

## Update

1. Run `npm install @playwright/test@latest`
1. Run `npx playwright install` to download the newest web drivers
1. Verify by ensuring that `npx playwright --version` matches the version listed in your package.json

### VS Code extensions

#### Required

1. **_Playwright Test for VScode_**
1. **_Prettier - Code formatter_** extensions. Set Prettier as a default formatter by `ctrl + shift + p` -> `Format document with` -> `Configure default formatter` and choose prettier.

#### Reccomended

1. [Pretty TS errors](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yoavbls.pretty-ts-errors) : enhances display of typescript errors
1. [TODO Highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wayou.vscode-todo-highlight) : browser all repo's tech dept with CTRL + SHIFT + P -> `highlight`

## Run

### Run preconfigured test scripts from `package.json`

```sh
npm run test:api
```

### Run single test with CLI

```sh
npm run test:e2e -- -g "[test title (or part of it)]"
```

#### Run test(s) in VSCode

With the [Playwright Test for VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright) you can easily run one or many tests.

You can also see the browser and debug tests as they are running. See the instructions on the extension's marketplace page for more information.  
In case the Green test arrow is not visible in your IDE attempt to reload with `ctrl + shift + p` -> `Developer: Reload Window`.
If the issue persists navigate to the `Testing` tab on the left. On the testing tab expand the playwright container and ensure the appropriate playwright project box is ticket.

## Contents

### Test Suite Flow

1. When a test or a collection of tests is triggered, the `.env` file is read to parse the ENV variables. For pipelines these vars are stored in [azure libraries](https://dev.azure.com/.../_library?itemType=VariableGroups).
1. From `package.json` based on the script that was selected, the project + the amount of workers are determined. Number of workers cannot be larger than the number of sets in [config.ts](/config/config.ts).
1. If workers are > 1 then the tests will be run in parallel. This is handled in [configHelper.ts](/config/configHelper.ts). Currently we have 2 sets, hence 2 workers max.
    1. First the correct set of sets per server is selected using `getConfigSetByParallelIndex`.
    2. Then the rest of the resources are sellected by the various functions.
1. From `playwright.config.ts` based on the project the following are determined:
    1. The Directory where the test runner will look for matching test files.
    2. Various preconfigured settings such as maximum test run time / browser permissions and other playwright available options.
    3. The report format which is common for all projects.
1. From the fixtures folder, the base `test` object is extended with API services + E2E components. The base expect object is extended with custom matchers. 
1. Setup and teardown :
    1. Per fixture is implemented before and after the `use` function respectively. 
    2. Per service is implemented on the service file itself just after the singleton logic. 

### Pipelines

Example API pipeline with azure devops setup is included

### Docker

To build the image without starting the container with `docker-compose build` from the root of the project. If you also want to start the container use `docker-compose up`.   
The env vars will be collected from the .env file. To overide an env var run the container with `docker-compose run -e SERVER=custom_server playwright-tests`

### TODOs and FIXMEs
Code can be marked with the following 2 options. You can use the [TODO Highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wayou.vscode-todo-highlight) to browse them.

- //TODO: For all items related to tech dept and generic improvements.
- //FIXME: For all items/tests that are skipped. Either they are validly failing with no planned resolution in the near future OR that they are still underÂ development.
